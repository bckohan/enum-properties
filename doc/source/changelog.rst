===================

* Implemented `Add a StrEnumProperties type to match StrEnum. <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/54>`_

v1.5.2 (2023-05-06)
===================

v1.5.1 (2023-04-17)
===================

* Fixed `Symmetric string 'none' values enable coercion from None despite match_none=False <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/45>`_

v1.5.0 (2023-04-17)
===================

There is one minimally impactful breaking change in the 1.5.0 release:

* Symmetric properties that are None will not map back to the enumeration value
  by default. To replicate the previous behavior, pass True as the `match_none`
  argument when instantiating the property with s().

The 1.5.0 release includes two feature improvements:

* Implemented `Configurable behavior for matching none on symmetric fields <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/44>`_
* Implemented `Allow @specialize to accept a list of enumeration values. <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/43>`_

v1.4.0 (2023-04-08)
===================

There are some breaking changes in the 1.4.0 release:

* The `enum_properties` attribute that lists property names has been changed to
  the sunder name `_properties_`.

* Properties on combinations of flag enumerations that are not specified in
  the members list instead of being None, no longer exist. Accessing them will
  result in an AttributeError.

The 1.4.0 release includes some significant performance improvements. Property
access speed has been improved by over 5x and the memory footprint has
been reduced by about 1/3.

* Fixed `All utility members added by EnumProperties should be sunder names. <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/41>`_
* Fixed `auto() broken for flag enums that declare combinations as members of the enum. <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/40>`_
* Implemented `Performance improvements <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/39>`_
* Implemented `Provide a decorator to provide function overrides per enum value. <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/36>`_
* Fixed `Address python 3.11+ deprecation warnings. <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/38>`_
* Fixed `New flag behavior modifiers break IntFlagProperties in python 3.11+ <https://github.com/bckohan/enum-properties/issues/37>`_
