Enumerations in Python can provide rich class based interfaces, well suited to many scenarios. Two
real world examples are presented here that leverage enum properties to encapsulate more
information and get our enums to do more work.

Address Route Type
__________________

The USPS maintains a `list <https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28apc_002.htm>`_ of valid route types
for United States addresses. We'd like to construct an address model that is searchable based on
route type. A natural (and space efficient!) choice to represent the route is an enumeration. The
USPS also maintains a list of official and common abbreviations for address routes. We'd like to
encapsulate this information and parsing logic directly into our enumeration. We might implement
it like so:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/examples/address.py
    :lines: 1-19

The builtin ``name`` property is the long-form official name for the route. By default enum
properties does not make the ``name`` property case insensitive, so we override the default
behavior by specifying a type hint for it. We also add a case insensitive abbreviation property and
alt property. The alt property is a list of common alternative abbreviations. Now we can
instantiate our enum from any valid route name, abbreviation or common alternative like so:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/examples/address.py
    :lines: 21-29

We use an integer literal as our enumeration values to save space if these enumerations need to be
persisted in a datastore by value. By specifying them directly instead of using ``auto()`` we
reserve the ability to add additional route types in alphabetical order without accidentally
invalidating any persisted data.

MapBox Style
____________

`Mapbox <https://mapbox.com>`_ is a popular web mapping platform. It comes with a handful of
default map styles. An enumeration is a natural choice to represent these styles but the styles are
complicated by the fact that they are versioned and that when used as a parameter in the mapbox API
they are in a URI format that is overly verbose for a human friendly user interface.

Each mapbox style enumeration is therefore composed of 4 primary properties. A name slug used in
the URI, a human friendly label for the style, a version number for the style and the full URI
specification of the style. We might implement our style enumeration like so:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/examples/mapbox.py
    :lines: 1-36

We've used the style's name slug as the value of the enumeration. If storage was an issue
(e.g. database) we could have separated this out into a separate property called ``slug`` and used
a small integer or single character as the enumeration value. We've also added a symmetric case
insensitive human friendly label for each style and a version property.

The version numbers will increment over time, but we're only concerned with the most recent
versions, so we'll increment their values in this enumeration as they change. If this enumeration
is persisted by value, any version number updates exist only in code and will be picked up as those
persisted values are re-instantiated as ``MapBoxStyle`` enumerations.

The last property we've added is the ``uri`` property. We've added it as concrete property on the
class because it can be created from the slug and version. We could have specified it in the value
tuple but that would be very verbose and less
`DRY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`_. To make this property symmetric we
decorate it with :py:func:`~enum_properties.symmetric`.

We can use our enumeration like so:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/examples/mapbox.py
    :lines: 38-47
